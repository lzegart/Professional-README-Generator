  ## Description
  This program generates a README file with all the headings and contents expected in a professional README. The Table of Contents links to each heading on click. Contact links are also included. 

  This program uses inquirer to prompt an array of questions to the user, store the responses, generate the responses to Markdown, and then write the most recent user responses to a README file in the output folder.

  This README Generator can be used to create a README file for any future repository created.
